# Timekeepers

I've built this project on Vite and used React library along with Tailwind. The project is completely responsive and contains the complete functionality of user Login, Sign Up and Add/Remove from Cart. All the data is stored in local storage. Website also contains the functionality of Dark Mode.

Technologies which I've used:

1. React - for component reuseablility
2. React Router Dom - for routing and navigation
3. Redux Toolkit - for global state management
4. Tailwind CSS - for styling
5. React Hot Toast - for beautiful toast components
6. React Icons - for icons

I've also used some third party components and SVGs for better UI experience.
